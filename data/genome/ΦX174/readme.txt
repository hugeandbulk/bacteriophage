Atomic structure of single-stranded DNA bacteriophage ΦX174 and its functional implications.
>> Bacteriophage ΦX174 is a small icosahedral virus that contains a single-stranded, closed circular DNA molecule with 5,386 nucleotide bases.

What is the genome of phiX174?

5,386 nucleotides

It is a small, icosahedral, nontailed virus with a circular single-stranded DNA. From its isolation in 1935 up to now, PhiX174 has been used in many landmark experiments because of its small genome size (5,386 nucleotides [nt]) and nonpathogenic status.

What is the genome of bacteriophage 174 consists of?

This bacteriophage has a circular single-stranded DNA genome made of 5386 nucleotides which encodes 11 proteins. Of these 11 genes, only 8 are essential to viral morphogenesis. So the correct answer is 'Single-stranded DNA'.

What is the genetic material of phiX174 bacteriophage?

So, the correct answer is 'SSDNA'

How big is the genome of phiX174?

5386 nt

Thermo Scientific phiX174 was the first DNA virus discovered to have a single-stranded, circular genome. phiX174 DNA is 5386 nt in length.

What is the structure of Phi 174?

The structure of the single-stranded DNA phage phiX174 has been determined to 3.4 A resolution. The crystal space group was P2(1) with one icosahedral particle per asymmetric unit, giving 60-fold noncrystallographic redundancy.

What is phiX174 Ssdna?

ΦX174 Virion DNA is the single-stranded viral DNA isolated from bacteriophage ΦX174 am3 cs70. It has a molecular weight of 1.70 x 106 daltons and is 5386 bases in length. Greater than 85% of the molecules are circular.

How many base pairs are in phix174?

Hence, 1 base pair has 2 nucleotides. So, 5386 nucleotides will have 5386/ 2 = 2693 base pairs.

Which of the following is correct with respect to the genetic material of φ174 bacteriophage?

Which of the following is correct with respect to the genetic material of Φ174 bacteriophage? Explanation: The genetic material of Φ174 bacteriophage is single-stranded DNA which is circular in shape. It has 5386 bases or a number of nucleotides.

Who discovered the phage ΦX174?

work of Sanger

…the DNA sequence of bacteriophage ΦX174, the first complete genome to be sequenced.

How many nucleotides are in Phi 174?

A DNA sequence for the genome of bacteriophage phi X174 of approximately 5,375 nucleotides has been determined using the rapid and simple 'plus and minus' method.

What is the size of bacteriophage Phi X174?

The phi X174 particle was observed to be an icosahedral particle of 25 nm in diameter carrying a spike at each vertex. The spike was a pentagonal frustum with a base of 9 nm and a height of 6 nm.
