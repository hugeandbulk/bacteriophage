What is ΦX174 sequencing?
The ΦX174 bacteriophage was the very first organism to have the whole genome sequenced in 1977. Various research groups began sequencing DNA, with Fredrick Sanger and colleagues introducing the chain-termination process in 1977, resulting in a breakthrough.

What is ΦX174 Ssdna?
ΦX174 Virion DNA is the single-stranded viral DNA isolated from bacteriophage ΦX174 am3 cs70. It has a molecular weight of 1.70 x 106 daltons and is 5386 bases in length. Greater than 85% of the molecules are circular.

What does the ΦX174 bacteriophage contain?
This bacteriophage has a [+] sense circular single-stranded DNA genome of 5,386 nucleotides. The genome GC-content is 44% and 95% of nucleotides belong to coding genes. Because of the balance base pattern of the genome, it is used as the control DNA for Illumina sequencers.

What is the bacteriophage known as ΦX174?
ΦX174 is a small icosahedral, tailless bacteriophage with a maximum diameter of ∼320 Å. The capsid contains a 5.3-kb circular, single-stranded (ss) DNA genome that encodes four structural proteins: the capsid protein F, the spike protein G, the genome-associated protein J, and the DNA pilot protein H.
