bacteriophage
———————————-—
Bacteriophage are viruses composed of proteins and have DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The bacteriophage replicates in the bacterium cell and injects its genome into the cytoplasm of the bacterium cell.
Bacteriophage genomes can be highly mosaic, i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules. These modules may be found in other phage species in different arrangements.

Are bacteriophages classified by genome?
ClassiPhage classifies phages exclusively based on genome sequence data and can be applied on distinct phage genomes as well as on prophage regions within host genomes.
