# bacteriophage
bacteriophage genomics with Perl.

**Declared:**

_A bacteriophage is a type of virus that infects bacteria. In fact, the word "bacteriophage" literally means "bacteria eater," because bacteriophages destroy their host cells. All bacteriophages are composed of a nucleic acid molecule that is surrounded by a protein structure_.

_Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that infect and replicate only in bacterial cells. They are ubiquitous in the environment and are recognized as the most abundant biological agent on earth. They are extremely diverse in size, morphology, and genomic organization_.

Why is a bacteriophage a virus?

_We have bacteria that live on us, and bacteria have bacterial viruses that live on them. These viruses are called bacteriophages (or phages). Viruses differ from bacteria in that they are not made of cells, but instead consist of a piece of DNA (or RNA) packed within a protein coat_.

Why is bacteriophage used?

_Phages, formally known as bacteriophages, are viruses that solely kill and selectively target bacteria. They are the most common biological entities in nature, and have been shown to effectively fight and destroy multi-drug resistant bacteria_.
