bacteriophage genomics with Perl.

**Declared:**

_A bacteriophage is a type of virus that infects bacteria. In fact, the word "bacteriophage" literally means "bacteria eater," because bacteriophages destroy their host cells. All bacteriophages are composed of a nucleic acid molecule that is surrounded by a protein structure_.

Why is a bacteriophage a virus?

_We have bacteria that live on us, and bacteria have bacterial viruses that live on them. These viruses are called bacteriophages (or phages). Viruses differ from bacteria in that they are not made of cells, but instead consist of a piece of DNA (or RNA) packed within a protein coat_.
